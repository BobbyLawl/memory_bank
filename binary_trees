BINARY SEARCH TREES I - Binary Tree Iterative Search
--------------------------------------------------
Binary Trees consist of nodes that are linked and begin with a single root node. This node then branches into two mode nodes;       <the root node in a binary tree is akin to the head of a linked list>
                                                                                                                                  <It's called a Binary Tree because each node can point to two other nodes>
  the nodes that "branch off" from the root are "branch nodes" and the nodes at the end of these branches are called Leaf Nodes.

VARIANT - Binary Search Tree:
  This is a Binary Tree with additional requirements(aka Rules);  All nodes LEFT of a node must have smaller values.  All Nodes RIGHT of a node msut have larger values.
  This is an O(log n) to search;
        Example: We have a phone book and were searching for the name Smith - We open the book to the P section and decide... Smith is on the right side, so we drop the left half of the data
                                                                                  at that point. Then we open it again - to the T section, This time we can throw away everything to the right
                                                                                  because we know S comes before T.    
                                                                                                                      - This is a powerful and quick way to search compared to O(n)
                                                                                                                      


BINARY SEARCH TREES II - Binary Tree Recursive Search
---------------------------------------------------
How it works:
- Start by comparing the calue at the root with what we're searching for, then:
- If the value is less than root's value:
  - Recursively search the left BST
Else:
  -Recursively search the right BST
- When you find the node, return True
-If you do not find the node and fall off the end of the BST, return False
                                                                              **Each call return the result of its recursive**
